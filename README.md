# sign-up-form-project
As a learning exercise, this will be a simulation of a sign-up-form to explore how to build a user-friendly form. The other goal of this project will be to practice building a web page 1-for-1 from a template exactly. 

In a follow-up project, I will make another sign up page, but for the purpose of using creative freedom to have the page look like how I want it to look.
